Itâ€™s very nature of being a cryptocurrency means it is borderless, and thus facilitates remittance transactions by its very nature. But Dala is more than that. It is the cornerstone of a financial services platform that has been designed to help those in most need of it - the financially excluded. This platform is global; bridging the divide between investors and consumers; creating opportunities for philanthropists, lenders, insurers, and most importantly, the financially excluded consumers. </div>",
